When you start to use Armadillo as a backend for DataSHIELD you can use the `DSMolgenisArmadillo` package for research purposes.
There is a default workflow in DataSHIELD to do analysis. There are several steps that you need to take:

### Authenticate
The login procedure consists of building a login dataframe and performing the login on the Armadillo server. The important part is to specify the driver. This should be `ArmadilloDriver`. 

We use oauth to authenticate in DataSHIELD.
